<h2 id="disability-inclusion-matters">Disability inclusion matters</h2>
<p>Every child has the right to grow up feeling happy, safe and loved.
Free to play and learn with their peers. Free to find a sense of
belonging in the world and to feel valued – at home, at school and
within their community.</p>
<p>But many children struggle to realize these rights. Every day 240
million children with disabilities, or 10 per cent of the world’s
children, face various barriers that hinder their full participation in
society on an equal basis with others.</p>
<p>Barriers related to mobility or communication can prevent children
with disabilities from playing with friends, going to school or getting
routine vaccinations, medical help and even emergency support during a
crisis. Stigma and discrimination are also barriers that can lead to
further isolation, mental health issues, neglect and violence.</p>
<p>Disability inclusion starts when every one of us contributes to
removing physical, attitudinal and communication barriers, including in
the digital divide.</p>
<p>UNICEF’s vision is a world fit for every child. Inclusion is at the
heart of what we do, driven by our commitment to leave no child behind.

<h2 id="the-data-demands-action">The data demands action</h2>
<p>Disability inclusion is not new to UNICEF. It has been a growing area
of work for more than a decade. In 2021, UNICEF released the most
comprehensive statistical analysis of children with disabilities,
revealing that as many as 240 million children with disabilities
continue to be left behind.</p>
<p>Compared with children without disabilities, children with
disabilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>49%</strong> more likely to have <strong>never attended
school</strong></li>
<li><strong>34%</strong> more likely to be <strong>stunted</strong></li>
<li><strong>25%</strong> more likely to be <strong>wasted</strong></li>
<li><strong>41%</strong> more likely to <strong>feel discriminated
against</strong></li>
<li><strong>51%</strong> more likely to <strong>feel unhappy</strong>

</ul>
<p>The extent to which children with disabilities are deprived,
discriminated against and lack hope for the future makes it clear that
societies are not doing enough to realize the most basic human rights of
all children. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation even
worse.</p>
<p>Including children with disabilities in all aspects of life must be a
priority for all of us. If provided an environment that enables their
full participation, their energies, talents and ideas will make a
positive impact to families and communities, around the world.

colorful geometric shapes. Left Person: A young individual wearing a yellow
and black jacket with a focused expression. They are holding a green
geometric shape, possibly a cylinder or a cone, and appear to be placing
it on a table.
Right Person: Another individual, possibly an
adult, wearing a denim jacket. They are smiling and also handling a

assisting or guiding the activity.
Activity Context: The activity seems educational

Background: The setting appears to be indoors,
possibly a classroom or a therapy room, with a neutral-colored
wall.

<h2 id="unicef-leading-the-way">UNICEF leading the way</h2>
<p>Since the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008, disability inclusion has
become a part of the human rights and development agendas, with
increased support and investment from the global community.</p>
<p>With its strong presence in 190 countries, UNICEF is uniquely
positioned to advance disability inclusion at scale across the globe.
UNICEF is a trusted partner not only for national governments but also
for donors, researchers, local and international civil society, and the
private sector.

<p>Within the United Nations system, UNICEF has a uniquely
cross-sectoral mandate and a comparative advantage in its ability to
raise attention to and invest in programming, research standard-setting,
and resource mobilization across contexts, sectors and political
environments, to shift norms and to promote inclusion for all children.

<h2 id="introducing-the-dipas">Introducing the DIPAS</h2>
<p>UNICEF’s Disability Inclusion Policy and Strategy (DIPAS) was
developed with the aim of delivering disability-inclusive support and
services for children in their communities and of mainstreaming
disability inclusion across every aspect of our work and our world.</p>
<p>Disability inclusion is not a new priority for UNICEF. It is included
in our 2022–2025 Strategic Plan and has been a growing area of work for
more than a decade. The DIPAS is guided by the CRPD, the Convention on
the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the United Nations Disability
Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS).</p>
<p>Each thematic sector at UNICEF is already making progress towards its
own commitments on disability inclusion. What is new, though, is that
the DIPAS provides a road map for cross-sectoral coordination that goes
beyond our 2022–2025 Strategic Plan. It shows us how we can strengthen
service delivery in communities by working together; strategically,
across sectors. As one UNICEF, we will drive more efficient and
effective outcomes for children with disabilities. The DIPAS lays the
foundations for building truly inclusive communities.</p>
<p>The DIPAS also focuses inwards, providing comprehensive
organizational strategies to help UNICEF to become a model for an
inclusive, diverse workplace, and a global leader for disability
inclusion.
