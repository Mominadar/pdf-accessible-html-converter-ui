These skills of verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and critical thinking and analytical writing are foundational skills for applicants to a U.S. graduate program, regardless of educational or linguistic background or country of origin.\n\nAlthough the GRE Program has many studies of the predictive validity of the GRE General Test (which are available on the GRE website: www.ets.org/gre), a recent meta-analysis by non-ETS researchers Nathan Kuncel, Sarah Hezlett and Deniz Ones provides additional positive evidence of the relationship of the GRE General Test to various criteria of graduate school success.\u00b9 This meta-analysis is important because predictive validity studies are often difficult to conduct for a variety of reasons (e.g., insufficient data, test scores or predictors of success that do not vary greatly across examinees). Compared with earlier research, the Kuncel et al. meta-analysis improved on these studies by examining the validity of the GRE General Test for multiple disciplines using multiple measures of success, and by addressing statistical artifacts such as range restriction.\n\nOne strength of the Kuncel et al. research is that the meta-analysis analyzed data from a very large data set involving more than 1,753 independent samples based on a pool of more than 80,000 students. In addition, the study looked at five predictors of success and eight criteria for success. The predictors included the three measures of the GRE General Test (verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical reasoning), GRE Subject Test scores and undergraduate grade point average (UGPA). The criteria for success are shown in the figure to the left.\n\nEach of these criteria can be considered a different dimension of successful performance in graduate school.\n\n## Figure Description\n\n**Figure 1: The criteria for success**\n\nA diagram illustrating the criteria for success in graduate school, centered around the word \"SUCCESS.\" The criteria are represented as follows:\n\n- **1st Year Graduate GPA**\n- **Overall Graduate GPA**\n- **Comprehensive Exam Scores**\n- **Publication Citations**\n- **Research Productivity**\n- **Time to Degree**\n- **Degree Attainment**\n- **Faculty Ratings**\n\nEach criterion is connected to the central \"SUCCESS\" circle, indicating its contribution to successful performance in graduate school. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.156,t=0.089,r=0.943,b=0.335); page 0 (l=0.043,t=0.268,r=0.941,b=0.579), with ID 8e5f751c-c2e4-40e6-92d2-31c910413c9d -->\n\n## Results of the Kuncel et al. study\n\nResults from this study show that:\n\n1. The GRE **General Test** is a \"generalizably valid predictor of first-year graduate GPA, overall graduate GPA, comprehensive exam scores, publication citation counts and faculty ratings.\"\n\n2. The GRE **General Test** also correlates positively with degree attainment and research productivity.\n\n3. The GRE **General Test** has better predictive validity than undergraduate grades or letters of recommendation.\n\n4. The GRE **Subject Tests** are better predictors of success than either the GRE **General Test** or undergraduate GPA.\n\nThis meta-analysis study is important because these results apply across a range of intended academic majors, across native speakers of English and nonnative speakers of English, across traditional and nontraditional students and across master's and doctoral programs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.156,t=0.601,r=0.936,b=0.838), with ID 4767f962-5d6f-48a3-b5e8-bffa4b9262af -->\n\n## Text from Document\n\nKuncel, N.

The two tasks that comprise the AW are both considered essential in many fields of graduate study. These two tasks are complementary in that the first requires the writer to construct his/her own argument about an issue, and the second requires a critique of someone else's argument by assessing its claims. For virtually all disciplines, AW adds value to the GRE General Test because it provides unique information about test-taker abilities over and above skills measured in the Verbal and Quantitative measures.\n\nDemonstrating the construct validity of the writing measure can be done by showing how AW correlates with other measures it is intended to resemble. As an illustration, AW correlates positively with other samples of academic writing produced by examinees\u2019 as shown in the figure below. Examinees in this study were asked to provide two writing samples; one representing their typical written work and one not quite as well written.\n\nThis graph shows that there is a strong positive relationship between the GRE essay scores and both of the writing samples from examinees. It should be noted that the AW correlates with these other indicators of writing skill more closely than does the personal statement that many students submit with their applications.*\n\n### Graph Description\n\n**Title**: Relationship Between Mean GRE Writing Assessment Scores and Mean Undergraduate Course-Related Writing Sample\n\n- **X-Axis**: Mean GRE Writing Assessment Scores\n  - Scale: 0 to 6, in increments of 0.5\n- **Y-Axis**: Mean Writing Sample\n  - Scale: 0 to 6, in increments of 0.5\n\n**Data Representation**:\n- Two lines are plotted on the graph.\n  - **Blue Line**: Represents the relationship between GRE scores and typical writing samples.\n  - **Orange Line**: Represents the relationship between GRE scores and less well-written samples.\n\n**Trends**:\n- Both lines show a positive trend, indicating that higher GRE writing scores are associated with higher quality writing samples.\n- The blue line is consistently above the orange line, suggesting that typical writing samples are rated higher than less well-written samples. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.058,t=0.088,r=0.836,b=0.514), with ID 942000e7-a46e-430f-ad23-80fa4139bd10 -->\n\n## Relationship Between Mean GRE Writing Assessment Scores and Mean Undergraduate Course-Related Writing Sample\n\nThis figure presents a line graph illustrating the relationship between GRE Writing Assessment scores and the mean scores of undergraduate course-related writing samples.
