<p>Dr Omar Abdi, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Programmes: UNICEF
works across more than 190 countries and territories, promoting the
rights and wellbeing of every child in everything we do. UNICEF
advocates for and supports governments to create enabling environments
and equal opportunities for all children to survive and thrive,
including the over 240 million boys and girls with disabilities living
in the world today. Our work on disability inclusion is mandated by the
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and aligned with the UN
Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) and the UNICEF Strategic Plan.
With the 2017 Executive Directive on Accessibility in Programme-Related
Construction Activities (CF/EXD/2017-004), UNICEF reaffirms its
commitment to ensure physical accessibility is a principle for all the
infrastructure that is built through our programmes, including in
humanitarian action. This toolkit is a result of extensive consultations
with UNICEF employees, partners and persons with disabilities. It’s a
set of technical resources that will help our staff to promote and
support accessibility and inclusion across our programmes and
operations. We invite UNICEF colleagues and partners to apply this
guidance in their work, to ensure that construction related to our
programmes, such as school buildings, health clinics, water and
sanitation facilities, are free of environmental barriers.</p>
<p>Hannan Sulieman, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Management: UNICEF
is committed to promote an accessible and inclusive work environment for
every employee and is investing to increase opportunities for persons
with disabilities to join our workforce. This Accessibility Toolkit is
an important resource to help us deliver on this commitment, respecting
and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in programmes and
operations across the organization. In 2014, a staff survey on
accessibility of UNICEF programmes and premises revealed that 84 per
cent of offices required awareness-raising materials and technical
capacity on accessibility. In a follow-up All-Staff Survey in 2019, only
39 per cent of respondents deemed their office space was physically
accessible for persons with disabilities. To address the growing
internal demand for resources to improve our office buildings, we
established a Greening and Accessibility Fund, developed guidance to
support renovations for environmentally friendly and accessible premises
and set up the Environmental Footprint and Accessibility Assessment Tool
(EFAAT). Data as of 2021 shows us that 52 per cent of UNICEF premises
meet “level 1”, the minimum organisational requirements for
accessibility. But we can do better, and we must do better. UNICEF’s
Strategic Plan Indicator E2.5 on Percentage of UNICEF offices that are
disability inclusive and accessible, sets a target of <span class="math inline">$100 \%$</span> by 2025. This is an ambitious
target, but for UNICEF’s 100% organizational commitment on disability
inclusion, only a target of <span class="math inline">$100 \%$</span>
of accessibility in our premises and operations can be acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-the-toolkit">Introduction to the toolkit</h2>
<p>This toolkit was developed so the work of UNICEF programmes can
support children like nine-year-old Amal, a girl with a physical
disability who lives in Zaatari camp and who can now play with other
children because the local playground has been made accessible to all.
It can support children like Frinpali, a seven-year-old boy who uses a
wheelchair and now receives appropriate education in Burkina Faso
because his school has been made accessible. This toolkit has been
conceived as an instrument to facilitate the dialogue with partners and
the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) on
accessibility-related issues. And it has been developed with UNICEF’s
current and future employees with disabilities and other organizations
in mind, so that the facilities they work in are made more accessible
and inclusive for all.</p>
<p>This Toolkit on Accessibility: Tools to apply universal design across
premises and programmes and promote access for all was developed to help
UNICEF programmes and operations to become more accessible. It
facilitates dialogue with partners, including OPDs on accessible
construction. <img alt="img-7.jpeg" src="img-7.jpeg"/></p>

<p>This Accessibility Toolkit offers information on how to build or
adapt infrastructure both in UNICEF-supported programmes and in UNICEF
premises, for use by all, including persons with disabilities. Its
contents can also be applied to non-UNICEF construction processes and
facilities as it takes into consideration international standards.</p>
<p>The guidance provided can be used to enhance and promote
accessibility when planning and designing the new construction of
programme facilities and infrastructure both in development and
humanitarian contexts, and when upgrading or adapting existing
infrastructure.</p>
<p>To summarize, information can be used at different points in the
accessibility journey, such as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Planning and designing UNICEF’s offices, guest houses and other
buildings</p></li>
<li><p>Planning and designing programme-related facilities</p></li>
<li><p>Remodelling, renovating, extending or repairing UNICEF’s offices,
guest houses and other buildings</p></li>
<li><p>Remodelling, renovating, extending or repairing programme-related
facilities and premises</p></li>
<li><p>Selecting facilities for leasing, renting or hosting conferences
and events</p></li>
<li><p>Managing and setting up humanitarian and emergency
programmes</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing construction contracts and agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring and evaluating projects involving construction,
renovation or repairs</p></li>
<li><p>Conducting accessibility assessments of existing facilities or
premises</p></li>
<li><p>Advocating for accessibility with donors and partners</p></li>
<li><p>Developing a curriculum for trainings on accessibility or
accessible construction processes</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="accessibility-is-everyones-task">ACCESSIBILITY IS EVERYONE’S
TASK</h1>
<p>To enable persons with disabilities to access and use a facility with
safety, comfort and dignity, the built environment not only must be
physically accessible but the relevant personnel must be aware of
accessibility-related issues and how to communicate and assist persons
with disabilities. The personnel may include people who are in charge of
security at entrances and at the reception and of facilities management,
as well as those involved in emergency evacuation, etc. While this
toolkit addresses issues related to physical accessibility, simultaneous
actions are also required to sensitize and train key personnel on the
inclusion of persons with disabilities. The following videos developed
by the Disability Section could be useful in this regard: <span class="math inline">$\checkmark$</span> Disability Orientation, <a href="https://sites.unicef.org/disabilities/index_66434.html">https://sites.unicef.org/disabilities/index_66434.html</a>,

<h1 id="target-audience">Target audience</h1>
<p>While this toolkit is primarily for UNICEF employees involved in
construction activities, operations focal points or programme colleagues
in charge of construction, it can also be useful for UNICEF partners,
other United Nations agencies, OPDs, non-governmental organizations,
local authorities and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>This toolkit contributes to the implementation of the United Nations
Disability Inclusion Strategy and helps to achieve and exceed most of
the strategy’s indicators: lack of physical accessibility, specifically
recognized as one of the barriers to inclusion in Indicator 6 on
Accessibility, 6.1 on Accessibility of conferences and events, Indicator
7 on Reasonable accommodation and Indicator 5 on Consultation with
persons with disabilities. The toolkit helps to report on United Nations
Country Team scorecards and to build the capacity of implementing
partners on accessibility. <img alt="img-9.jpeg" src="img-9.jpeg"/></p>

<h1 id="frameworks-and-approaches">Frameworks and approaches</h1>
<h2 id="convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities">Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</h2>
<p>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
<span class="math inline">${ }^{1}$</span> is an international human
rights treaty of the United Nations intended to protect the rights and
dignity of persons with disabilities. It was adopted on 13 December 2006
and describes human rights frameworks linked to accessibility, aspects
of universal design, reasonable accommodation and international
standards for accessibility. UNICEF’s existing commitments and policies
to promote accessibility are aligned with the CRPD.</p>
<p>The accessibility of spaces and places determines the extent to which
everyone including persons with disabilities, older persons and children
- can live, work and learn independently and participate fully and
equally in society. Equal access to transportation, media, information
and communication technologies, and public services and facilities, such
as schools, libraries and town halls, facilitates the participation of
persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural communities.
Accessibility is also critical in emergency contexts, such as refugee
camps, to ensure access to humanitarian services and facilities.</p>
<p>As of October 2021,184 countries have ratified the CRPD and,
increasingly, countries around the world have adopted standards, codes
and laws to mandate accessibility, in line with CRPD requirements.</p>
<p>Accessibility is one of the primary principles of the CRPD, set out
in article 3 as a vital precondition for the effective and equal
enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for
persons with disabilities, for example to health, education, information
and communication. Other CRPD articles related to accessibility are
article 9: Accessibility; article 19: Living independently and being
included in the community; article 24: Education; and article 30:
Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport.</p>
<h2 id="universal-design">Universal design</h2>
<p>In the 1980s, the American architect Ron Mace coined the term
‘universal design’, which means good design that benefits everyone.
<span class="math inline">${ }^{2}$</span> Universal design is defined
in the CRPD as “the design of products, environments, programmes and
services to be usable by all people, to the greatest possible extent,
without needing adaptation or specialized design” (article 2). <span class="math inline">${ }^{3}$</span></p>
<p>Seven principles underpin the concept of universal design, summarized
as follows:</p>
<p>1 Equitable use: Providing the same means of use for all users, with
and without disabilities</p>
<p>2 Flexibility in use: Accommodating individual preferences and
abilities, such as left- or right-handedness</p>
<p>3 Simple and intuitive use: Ensuring easy to understand utilization,
including for people with low literacy</p>
<p>4 Perceivable information: Communicating key information clearly and
in multiple ways</p>
<p>5 Error tolerance: Minimizing hazards and adverse consequences of
accidental actions</p>
<p>6 Low physical effort: Requiring little operating force to use</p>
<p>7 Size and space: Providing appropriate space for reach and use, if
seated or standing</p>
<p>The outcome of using universal design is that environments, buildings
and products are inclusive of, usable by and accessible to everyone, to
the greatest possible extent, including children, adults and older
persons with and without disabilities, pregnant women, parents with
children or using baby strollers, and people carrying heavy equipment,
suitcases, groceries, etc.</p>
<p>The concept of universal design applies to almost every area of life.
While this toolkit focuses on the accessibility of infrastructure and
spaces, the concept also applies to many other areas, programmes and
services, such as mobility (e.g., accessible cars, buses or trains;
inclusive bus stations; accessible communication on mobility-related web
platforms), communication (e.g., inclusive events, sign language
interpretation; meetings or lessons; easy-to-read publications;
accessible posters) and information and communication technology (e.g.,
accessible web services and mobile apps; audiovisual content with
captions and transcriptions; accessible files and software).</p>
<p>Accessibility is one of the core elements of the United Nations
Disability Inclusion Strategy. While it is emphasized in all four
pillars, accessibility is included also in specific dedicated Indicator
6.</p>
<h1 id="the-accessibility-continuum">The accessibility continuum</h1>
<p>The accessibility continuum is a concept that describes the
experience of children, adults with disabilities and older persons
departing from their homes, using pathways, crossing roads and taking
transportation to reach, enter and use services and facilities. These
facilities can be libraries, public meeting halls, sports fields, health
care facilities, courthouses, marketplaces, conference rooms, office
buildings, etc. A continuous route means that circulating through it is
safe, unrestricted and possible using a wheelchair, a walking frame or a
service dog, with no obstacles or barriers blocking the way. Such a
route must be continuous because, like in a chain, if one link is
broken, the chain is compromised.</p>
<p>Four steps ensure the accessibility continuum: reaching a facility;
entering a facility; moving around a facility; and using specific
features of a facility. <span class="math inline">${ }^{4}$</span>
These align with the RECU methodology that stipulates that accessible
facilities should be easy to reach, enter, circulate and use. <span class="math inline">${ }^{5}$</span></p>
<p>Planning for an accessible environment requires a broad vision of the
accessibility continuum perspective. For example, if the route from home
to school is accessible for a child who uses crutches but there are
stairs at the school entrance and classroom doors are hard to push and
pull, the child will have difficulty entering the school or learning and
participating in activities with his/her peers.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a UNICEF staff member using a wheelchair has an
adjustable desk, an accessible work space with appropriate doorway sizes
and accessible toilets, he/she will be able to work on an equal basis
with others. However, if he/she is unable to independently access the
building because there is no accessible parking space, dropoff zone or
kerb (ramp) to get on the sidewalk, the overall accessibility of the
workplace is compromised.</p>
<p>At least 10 common pitfalls can be avoided or remedied, often at low
or no cost, to achieve an accessibility continuum.</p>

<p>Other considerations to promote inclusion include: Welcoming,
respectful attitudes - If a school is physically accessible but the
teacher has a negative, discriminatory attitude and does not want to
teach a child with a disability, unless the teacher’s attitude is
changed, the child’s access to education will be limited. Attitudes can
be improved through role models, interaction with other teachers and
students with disabilities, experiential training or campaigns, and
programmes to transform harmful social norms.</p>
<p>Culturally appropriate technical resources or assistive devices - If
a school is physically accessible but a child with mobility impairments
does not have a wheelchair to reach it, or if no pedagogical tools and
assistive devices have been adapted to support children who are blind
(such as Braille devices or screen-reading software), some children may
not attend school at all. Some of these gaps can be filled through
access to reasonable accommodation.</p>
<h1 id="technical-accessibility-standards">Technical accessibility
standards</h1>
<p>Many of the technical specifications in this toolkit are based on
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards,
developed by a committee of experts. In particular, ISO 21542:2011
‘Building construction - Accessibility and usability of the built
environment’ applies to construction and the modification of new and
existing buildings and is available to UNICEF staff via the Supply
Division.</p>
<p>Related ISO standards cover accessible lifts (4190-1), emergencies
(22320), assistive devices such as tactile walking surface indicators
(23599) and graphical symbols for public information and accessibility
(7001). Some of the common global symbols used for accessibility are
available in the Toolbox.</p>
<p>For UNICEF programmes, ISO 21542 can be applied to all
construction-related activities. While dimensions in the standard are
geared primarily towards adults, it also recognizes that people across
age levels have different needs, so it incorporates, for example,
accessibility in toilets designed for children. In addition,
accessibility for children is considered in this toolkit based on other
existing guidelines and principles. <span class="math inline">\({

<h1 id="new-urban-agenda">New Urban Agenda</h1>
<p>In 2016 during Habitat III, the United Nations Conference on Housing
and Sustainable Urban Development, global leaders came together in
Ecuador with local governments, mayors and constituency groups to
establish the New Urban Agenda. The New Urban Agenda commits governments
to promoting: <span class="math inline">$\checkmark$</span> quality

<h2 id="united-nations-commitment-to-accessibility---undis">United
Nations commitment to accessibility - UNDIS</h2>
<p>During the twelfth Conference of States Parties to the Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, United Nations
Secretary-General António Guterres launched the United Nations
Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS).</p>
<p>The policy establishes the highest levels of commitment and a vision
for the United Nations system on disability inclusion for the next
decade, and aims to create an institutional framework for the
implementation of the CRPD and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, among other international human rights instruments and
development and humanitarian commitments.</p>
<p>The accountability framework tracks the implementation of the policy
for the entire system. It facilitates the assessment of progress and
gaps in the work of the United Nations on mainstreaming disability
inclusion with a view to advancing system-wide planning and action,
promoting synergies and reducing duplication. The accountability
framework comprises two related components: an entity accountability
framework and</p>
<p>a United Nations country team accountability scorecard on disability
inclusion. Each component includes a set of common system indicators
focused on four core areas: leadership, strategic planning and
management; inclusiveness; programming; and organizational culture.</p>
<p>Accessibility is one of the core elements of the UNDIS. While it is
emphasized in all four pillars, accessibility is included also in a
specific dedicated indicator.</p>
<h1 id="unicef-commitments-to-accessible-programmes-and-premises">UNICEF
commitments to accessible programmes and premises</h1>
<h2 id="unicef-executive-directives">UNICEF executive directives</h2>
<p>Two executive directives issued by UNICEF relate to disability and
inclusion. The first, CF/EXD/2011-005 on disability, sets out the
minimum requirements for the accessibility of UNICEF premises and
procedures for employing staff with disabilities. A disability
accommodation fund was also established by UNICEF to support staff with
disabilities.</p>
<p>The second directive, the Executive Directive on Accessibility in
UNICEF’s ProgrammeRelated Construction Activities, was issued in
December 2017 (CF/EXD/2017-004) to systematically address issues related
to the accessibility of the physical environment in programmes. This
directive requires UNICEF to adopt accessibility and universal design in
all projects with governments and partners across all programme areas,
and applies to all new construction, remodelling, extensions or repairs
both in development and humanitarian contexts. As stated in the
directive, “Accessibility is an enabler that allows children and adults
with disabilities to enjoy their rights and entitlements. It is also a
precondition for children and adults with disabilities to live
independently and participate fully and equally in society”.</p>
<p>This executive directive supplements the existing requirements for
the accessibility of premises in Property and Equipment Policy,
Supplement 6 - Guidelines for Premises Management and the UNICEF
Greening and Accessibility Fund (GrAF) procedures. The GrAF was
established in 2015, generated by a 3 per cent air travel surcharge,
with 2 per cent of the fund to be used to finance eco-efficiency
projects and 1 per cent to be used for accessibility projects (see also
Section D of the toolkit).</p>

<h1 id="advocacy-for-accessibility-3">Advocacy for accessibility</h1>
<p>UNICEF is in a strategic position to influence how accessibility is
taken into account in development and emergency projects. In fact, as
UNICEF collaborates with diverse stakeholders - including governments,
United Nations agencies, donors, civil society, non-governmental
organizations and academia - UNICEF staff members are well placed to
advocate for accessibility of programmes and premises to promote the
inclusion and participation of children and adults with
disabilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, when working with implementing partners, UNICEF should
reinforce the necessity for infrastructure accessibility in both
development and humanitarian contexts, by making accessibility a
requirement when working on new projects.</p>
<p>To be able to do so, UNICEF staff members must first become familiar
with accessibility frameworks and principles, both internal and
international, so their advocacy is informed, efficient and
convincing.</p>
<p>SECTION A of this toolkit provides strategies to advocate for
accessibility with stakeholders and partners (tips, FAQs) and arguments
to reply to common objections and preconceived ideas (misconceptions).

<p>Governments that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) are legally bound to it because they
have committed to implementing the Convention in their national laws and
practice as well as to reporting on progress on accessibility as part of
these commitments. The CRPD should be used as a basis for action on the
part of government departments, civil society organizations, educators,
school boards and municipalities. The status of ratification can be
checked on the United Nations CRPD portal.</p>

<p>Governments that have committed to implementing the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) are expected to adhere to several targets
related to accessibility in facilities. Accessibility is also a
condition for reaching Goals 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 4
(quality education), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic
growth) and 10 (reduced inequalities).</p>
<p>To contribute to these targets, building codes and standards can be
applied when assessing the accessibility of facilities.</p>

<p>Many countries have legislation that requires infrastructure to meet
the obligations of the CRPD or of laws and policies related to
disability or anti-discrimination accessibility. For example, it is
mandatory in Uganda for school buildings to be accessible to all.</p>
<ul>
<li>In countries that do not have national laws or regulations that
consider accessibility, UNICEF can support governments to develop
national building codes and standards and/or integrate the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards on accessibility and
usability of the built environment into existing codes and standards.
For example, national law in India mandates that all public buildings be
made accessible within five years of notification by a relevant
authority.</li>

<h2 id="partner-with-organizations-of-persons-with-disabilities-as-key-allies">Partner
with organizations of persons with disabilities as key allies</h2>
<p>People with disabilities and organizations of persons with
disabilities (OPDs) should be involved in all phases of an accessibility
project. People with disabilities can be encouraged to test, create or
provide input on construction-related solutions that can improve
accessibility, such as issues related to elevators. In addition, it is
possible to encourage their capacity development and their ability to
advocate for accessibility, conduct accessibility assessments,
understand if something is correctly designed, provide input on how to
improve existing or new features, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>UNICEF can host a specific consultation on accessibility with
persons with disabilities. For example, UNICEF can create opportunities
for persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities, to
share their stories and experiences, including on the barriers they face
when accessing facilities and services.</li>
<li>UNICEF can engage with children and adults with disabilities in
accessibility assessment processes or campaigns to raise awareness of
accessibility. UNICEF communication for development (C4D) staff could
engage OPDs to help with work on changing attitudes towards children
with disabilities. Accessibility should be included as one of the main
components of this initiative.</li>
<li>The requester can ensure the Request for Proposals is announced in
accessible formats (e.g., accessible in Word <span class="math inline">${ }^{10}$</span> ). This will increase

the SDGs, the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development conducts peer reviews of policies
and practices on human rights, which can include disability-inclusive
aid investments.</p>
<p>In addition to policies on accessibility and disability, donors can
promote disabilityrelated innovation and the use of assistive

asked questions on accessibility (FAQ)</h1>
<h2 id="q1-do-we-need-to-hire-accessibility-experts-to-work-on-universal-design">Q1:
Do we need to hire accessibility experts to work on universal
design?</h2>
<p>Hiring accessibility experts depends on the context. If the activity
is simple and not overly technical, anyone with knowledge of
accessibility can follow up on certain activities without being an
expert. To achieve quality results in more complex and technical
interventions, however, as is the case in any other sector, it is
important to have expertise on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="q2-do-we-need-to-change-and-improve-everything-all-at-once">Q2:
Do we need to change and improve everything all at once?</h2>
<p>No. The actions need to be prioritized. Some may need to be taken as
soon as possible, including to address areas that are potentially
dangerous or have restricted access. While many laws require
accessibility, it is possible to identify and progressively implement
improvements as part of a sequenced approach. People with disabilities
can advise on which interventions will promote universal design and
inclusion and may be able to share innovative ideas.</p>

<h2 id="q3-what-if-governments-do-not-have-accessibility-laws">Q3: What
if governments do not have accessibility laws?</h2>
<p>UNICEF has a role to play to encourage national governments to
integrate accessibility into their policies, codes, standards and
construction projects. Many countries are increasingly introducing laws
and standards and can invest in accessible construction and monitoring;
every project realized in those country must comply with national
accessibility regulations.</p>
<p>Governments that do not have existing accessibility or
non-discrimination laws, regulations and codes should use the ISO
standards <span class="math inline">${ }^{13}$</span> as a reference
for accessibility implementation. UNICEF staff and partners can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight that the cost of accessibility and inclusion is marginal,
especially when considered in the planning and design stages</li>
<li>Explain that accessibility and universal design also enable
children, pregnant women, older persons and people with temporary
impairments to gain greater and safer independence</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q4-what-if-donors-do-not-want-to-fund-accessibilityuniversal-design">Q4:
What if donors do not want to fund accessibility/universal design?</h2>
<p>UNICEF aims to promote equity and inclusion in line with the SDGs.
Several donor governments require that accessibility standards be met in
infrastructure-related projects and often already mandate adherence to
standards in procurement. Donors are increasingly prioritizing
accessibility and disability inclusiveness in aid. For example, the DFID
used to refer to the Australian Government’s Accessibility Design Guide
<span class="math inline">${ }^{14}$</span> as part of its commitments
to inclusive education. In addition to confirming existing commitments,
UNICEF staff and partners can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how accessibility is an obligation in the framework of the
CRPD, SDGs and national and international frameworks, as well as a human
right</li>
<li>Highlight that the cost of disability inclusion is marginal,

disability. <span class="math inline">${ }^{18}$</span> Consulting
with local OPDs helps to understand the challenges and priorities that
children and adults with disabilities face in accessing services, and
they should be asked for their recommendations and ideas. Persons with

example, easy-to-use door handles and ramps with handrails benefit
people using wheelchairs and crutches, pregnant women, persons carrying
heavy loads, older people, etc. Everyone benefits from
accessibility.</p>
<h2 id="m4-countries-do-not-need-to-integrate-accessibility-standards.">M4:
Countries do not need to integrate accessibility standards.</h2>
<p>FACT: Each of the 182 countries (as of 15 February 2021) that have
ratified the CRPD <span class="math inline">${ }^{19}$</span> is
legally bound to its requirements by the international community and is
required to report on accessibility compliance and progress (article 9).
Many countries have accessibility laws, standards and provisions, even
if partial or if relevant only to a specific sector. In Uganda, for
example, it is mandatory for school buildings to be accessible. <span class="math inline">${ }^{20}$</span></p>
<h2 id="m5-engaging-with-people-with-disabilities-requires-expert-knowledge.">M5:
Engaging with people with disabilities requires expert knowledge.</h2>
<p>FACT: It is not necessary to be an expert to start working towards
accessibility and disability inclusion. Hosting meetings and policy
dialogues in accessible venues can help to support the participation of
people with disabilities (see Section F). OPDs can be invited to join
construction-related conversations, and children and adults with
disabilities can be provided with opportunities to contribute and share
ideas. It is necessary to keep in mind, however, that the support of
partners specialized in disability inclusion is essential for the
success of more articulated interventions. <img alt="img-19.jpeg" src="img-19.jpeg"/></p>
