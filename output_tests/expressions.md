13. You could have created an equation to represent many of the problems on the previous page. For example, in #2, you were asked: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.060,t=0.047,r=0.922,b=0.080), with ID 01e2daf4-29d3-42b3-820c-c7e9c2eba4c0 -->

What value for $x$ makes the expression $x + 5$ equal to 7? In other words, when does the expression $x + 5$ equal 7? An **equation** is formed by setting two expressions equal to each other. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.099,r=0.915,b=0.133), with ID c1231fa3-bbbb-4d69-9d18-99a412074387 -->

## Detailed Description

The image is a diagram illustrating the concept of an equation. It shows two mathematical expressions separated by an equal sign, indicating that they are equal to each other.

- **Equation**: The equation displayed is $x + 5 = 7$.
  - **Expression 1**: $x + 5$
  - **Expression 2**: $7$

- **Annotations**:
  - A yellow arrow points to the equal sign, labeled with the text `"is equal to"`.
  - Below the equation, there are labels:
    - **Expression 1** is labeled under $x + 5$.
    - **Expression 2** is labeled under $7$.

This diagram visually explains that the two expressions on either side of the equal sign are equivalent. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.410,t=0.165,r=0.642,b=0.281), with ID 9385155c-5fc4-4643-81c5-166b6a654b1f -->

A **solution** to an equation is a number that **makes the equation true** when substituted for the unknown. Another way to think of this is to ask the question, “For what value of $x$ does the expression $x + 5$ evaluate to 7?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.058,t=0.323,r=0.929,b=0.354), with ID 3418e142-9108-4c5f-a6f1-bdbfaee579a9 -->

## Directions

Determine whether the given number is the solution to the equation given. Justify your answer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.058,t=0.374,r=0.900,b=0.389), with ID 20c1253e-f9bb-4d9f-ae4a-8e250dbde8f3 -->

## Description of Figure

The image appears to be a simplified icon or logo, likely representing a graph or chart. It features a black square with rounded corners. Inside the square, there is a white area containing a series of vertical bars of varying heights, resembling a bar chart or histogram. The bars are aligned next to each other, with the tallest bars towards the center and shorter bars on the sides, creating a symmetrical pattern. There are no numerical values, labels, or additional text present in the image. The overall design is minimalistic, focusing on the visual representation of data through the bar heights. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.711,t=0.044,r=0.753,b=0.074), with ID be559df7-3f00-4e3e-ad31-2d411a6c9201 -->
