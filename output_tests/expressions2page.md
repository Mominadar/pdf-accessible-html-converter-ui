13. You could have created an equation to represent many of the problems on the previous page. For example, in #2, you were asked: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.060,t=0.047,r=0.922,b=0.080), with ID 290c6d24-933c-4cce-9949-b8e51ade6760 -->

## Detailed Description

The image is a figure explaining how to solve the equation $x + 5 = 7$.

### Text Explanation

- The text at the top of the figure reads:
  - "What value for x makes the expression x + 5 equal to 7? In other words, when does the expression x + 5 equal 7? An **equation** is formed by setting two expressions equal to each other."

### Equation Breakdown

- The equation is presented as:
  - $x + 5 = 7$
  - This is broken down into two parts:
    - **Expression 1**: $x + 5$
    - **Expression 2**: $7$

### Visual Elements

- There is a yellow arrow pointing from the equal sign ($=$) with the label "is equal to."
- Underneath the expressions, there are labels:
  - "Expression 1" under $x + 5$
  - "Expression 2" under $7$

This figure is designed to visually explain the concept of an equation by showing how two expressions are set equal to each other. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.099,r=0.915,b=0.281), with ID cdbb602b-166e-4098-8e04-4cc4a03cffee -->

A **solution** to an equation is a number that **makes the equation true** when substituted for the unknown. Another way to think of this is to ask the question, “For what value of $x$ does the expression $x + 5$ evaluate to 7?” <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.058,t=0.323,r=0.929,b=0.354), with ID 78d9834f-76cb-4ba6-a37c-190d90c107a1 -->

## Description

The image is a black and white icon resembling a bar chart or histogram. It features a series of vertical bars of varying heights, arranged side by side. The bars are enclosed within a rounded square border. The background is black, and the bars are white, creating a high-contrast visual. There are no labels, numbers, or additional text present in the image. The icon likely represents data visualization or analytics. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.711,t=0.044,r=0.753,b=0.074), with ID 72a29a04-6337-4f5b-be6a-675c1a23a30d -->
