- **Grid Layout**: Each grid is a 10x10 square grid.
- **Figure Shape**: Each L-shaped figure occupies a 7x7 area on the grid.
- **Positioning**: 
  - The figures are positioned in the lower left corner of each grid.
  - The vertical part of the "L" extends upwards, and the horizontal part extends to the right.
- **Labeling**: 
  - The top of each grid is labeled with numbers "1", "2", and "3" corresponding to each figure.
- **Color**: The figures are filled with a light purple color, and the borders are a darker purple.

The figures are identical in shape and size, with no variations between them. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.060,t=0.083,r=0.921,b=0.309), with ID 8ed2cffc-19b4-4d48-a514-77f2af72debd -->

Gloria is painting a feature wall in her bedroom. The dimensions of the wall measure 14 feet by 11 feet. The gallon of paint that she purchased will cover 400 square feet. Does she have enough paint to do two coats on the wall? Justify your answer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.607,r=0.933,b=0.655), with ID 7ab5581e-b674-4bd0-aec0-ab7f56133d74 -->

Steven is designing a rectangular frame to go around a drawing that measures 11 inches by 8 inches. He has budgeted $15.00 to cover the cost of the material for the frame. He would like the frame to be 2 inches wide around the perimeter of the drawing. The diagram below shows the dimensions of the drawing and the frame. The material for the frame costs $0.20 per square inch. Will Steven have enough money to cover the cost of the frame? <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.711,r=0.585,b=0.848), with ID bfb9a42b-19e9-4987-89ad-9920ae30b9a9 -->

## Description of Figure

The image is a diagram of a rectangle with a surrounding border. The inner rectangle is labeled with dimensions, and the border is uniformly wide around the rectangle.

- **Inner Rectangle Dimensions**:
  - Width: 11 inches
  - Height: 8 inches

- **Border Width**:
  - The border is 2 inches wide on all sides of the rectangle.

The outer dimensions of the entire figure, including the border, can be calculated as follows:

- **Outer Width**: \(11 \, \text{in} + 2 \, \text{in (left border)} + 2 \, \text{in (right border)} = 15 \, \text{in}\)
- **Outer Height**: \(8 \, \text{in} + 2 \, \text{in (top border)} + 2 \, \text{in (bottom border)} = 12 \, \text{in}\)

The border is shaded differently from the inner rectangle, indicating a distinction between the two areas. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.618,t=0.714,r=0.916,b=0.893), with ID 34349e16-d0b5-4774-819b-1dfabb03ba2b -->

## Description of the Figure

The figure shows a problem related to calculating the area of a yard for laying grass sod. It includes a diagram of the yard, a calculation by Antonia, and a speech bubble with her explanation.

### Diagram Details

- The yard is depicted as an L-shaped area.
- The dimensions of the yard are labeled:
  - The top horizontal section is 22 feet long.
  - The left vertical section is 10 feet high.
  - The bottom horizontal section is 15 feet long.
  - The right vertical section is 25 feet high.

### Antonia's Calculation

Antonia has attempted to calculate the area of the yard by dividing it into two rectangles:

1. **First Rectangle**:
   - Dimensions: 10 feet by 22 feet.
   - Area Calculation: $10 \times 22 = 220$ square feet.

2. **Second Rectangle**:
   - Dimensions: 25 feet by 15 feet.
   - Area Calculation: $25 \times 15 = 375$ square feet.

- Antonia's Total Area Calculation:
  - She adds the areas of the two rectangles: $220 + 375 = 595$ square feet.
  - Antonia concludes: "So I will need 595 square feet of grass."

### Error Explanation

Antonia's mistake lies in the incorrect division of the yard into rectangles. The overlapping area or incorrect dimensions might have led to an incorrect total area calculation. The correct approach would involve ensuring the dimensions used for each rectangle accurately represent the yard's layout without overlap or omission.

### Correct Area Calculation

To find the correct area, the yard should be divided into non-overlapping rectangles, ensuring all parts of the L-shape are covered without duplication. The correct dimensions and calculations need to be verified to find the accurate total area. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.077,t=0.078,r=0.940,b=0.357), with ID ea6fc461-07fa-47a8-b200-54083068a2b6 -->

## Directions

For numbers 9-12, find the total area of each figure by decomposing it into non-overlapping regions. Assume that all angles that appear to be right angles are right angles. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.058,t=0.443,r=0.934,b=0.475), with ID 9b08c7e9-f3dc-4cba-9ca5-ef4bbc8543e6 -->
