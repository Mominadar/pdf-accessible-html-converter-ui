UNICEF advocates for and supports governments to create enabling environments and equal opportunities for all children to survive and thrive, including the over 240 million boys and girls with disabilities living in the world today.\nOur work on disability inclusion is mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and aligned with the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) and the UNICEF Strategic Plan. With the 2017 Executive Directive on Accessibility in Programme-Related Construction Activities (CF/EXD/2017-004), UNICEF reaffirms its commitment to ensure physical accessibility is a principle for all the infrastructure that is built through our programmes, including in humanitarian action.\nThis toolkit is a result of extensive consultations with UNICEF employees, partners and persons with disabilities. It's a set of technical resources that will help our staff to promote and support accessibility and inclusion across our programmes and operations. We invite UNICEF colleagues and partners to apply this guidance in their work, to ensure that construction related to our programmes, such as school buildings, health clinics, water and sanitation facilities, are free of environmental barriers.\n\nHannan Sulieman, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Management:\nUNICEF is committed to promote an accessible and inclusive work environment for every employee and is investing to increase opportunities for persons with disabilities to join our workforce. This Accessibility Toolkit is an important resource to help us deliver on this commitment, respecting and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in programmes and operations across the organization.\nIn 2014, a staff survey on accessibility of UNICEF programmes and premises revealed that 84 per cent of offices required awareness-raising materials and technical capacity on accessibility. In a follow-up All-Staff Survey in 2019, only 39 per cent of respondents deemed their office space was physically accessible for persons with disabilities.\nTo address the growing internal demand for resources to improve our office buildings, we established a Greening and Accessibility Fund, developed guidance to support renovations for environmentally friendly and accessible premises and set up the Environmental Footprint and Accessibility Assessment Tool (EFAAT).\nData as of 2021 shows us that 52 per cent of UNICEF premises meet \"level 1\", the minimum organisational requirements for accessibility. But we can do better, and we must do better. UNICEF's Strategic Plan Indicator E2.5 on Percentage of UNICEF offices that are disability inclusive and accessible, sets a target of $100 \\%$ by 2025. This is an ambitious target, but for UNICEF's 100\\% organizational commitment on disability inclusion, only a target of $100 \\%$ of accessibility in our premises and operations can be acceptable.",

It can support children like Frinpali, a seven-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair and now receives appropriate education in Burkina Faso because his school has been made accessible. This toolkit has been conceived as an instrument to facilitate the dialogue with partners and the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) on accessibility-related issues. And it has been developed with UNICEF's current and future employees with disabilities and other organizations in mind, so that the facilities they work in are made more accessible and inclusive for all.\n\nThis Toolkit on Accessibility: Tools to apply universal design across premises and programmes and promote access for all was developed to help UNICEF programmes and operations to become more accessible. It facilitates dialogue with partners, including OPDs on accessible construction.\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nNine-year-old Amal plays on the seesaw in the new inclusive playground in her school in Zaatari refugee camp, Jordan where she is in third grade.\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nFrinpali, a 7 year old boy who is using a wheelchair, and his friend Hassan at the playground of their school in Fada, in eastern Burkina Faso.",

It was adopted on 13 December 2006 and describes human rights frameworks linked to accessibility, aspects of universal design, reasonable accommodation and international standards for accessibility. UNICEF's existing commitments and policies to promote accessibility are aligned with the CRPD.\n\nThe accessibility of spaces and places determines the extent to which everyone including persons with disabilities, older persons and children - can live, work and learn independently and participate fully and equally in society. Equal access to transportation, media, information and communication technologies, and public services and facilities, such as schools, libraries and town halls, facilitates the participation of persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural communities. Accessibility is also critical in emergency contexts, such as refugee camps, to ensure access to humanitarian services and facilities.\n\nAs of October 2021,184 countries have ratified the CRPD and, increasingly, countries around the world have adopted standards, codes and laws to mandate accessibility, in line with CRPD requirements.\n\nAccessibility is one of the primary principles of the CRPD, set out in article 3 as a vital precondition for the effective and equal enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for persons with disabilities, for example to health, education, information and communication. Other CRPD articles related to accessibility are article 9: Accessibility; article 19: Living independently and being included in the community; article 24: Education; and article 30: Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport.\n\n## Universal design\n\nIn the 1980s, the American architect Ron Mace coined the term 'universal design', which means good design that benefits everyone. ${ }^{2}$ Universal design is defined in the CRPD as \"the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest possible extent, without needing adaptation or specialized design\" (article 2). ${ }^{3}$",

While this toolkit focuses on the accessibility of infrastructure and spaces, the concept also applies to many other areas, programmes and services, such as mobility (e.g., accessible cars, buses or trains; inclusive bus stations; accessible communication on mobility-related web platforms), communication (e.g., inclusive events, sign language interpretation; meetings or lessons; easy-to-read publications; accessible posters) and information and communication technology (e.g., accessible web services and mobile apps; audiovisual content with captions and transcriptions; accessible files and software).",

      "markdown": "Accessibility is one of the core elements of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy. While it is emphasized in all four pillars, accessibility is included also in specific dedicated Indicator 6.\n\n# The accessibility continuum \n\nThe accessibility continuum is a concept that describes the experience of children, adults with disabilities and older persons departing from their homes, using pathways, crossing roads and taking transportation to reach, enter and use services and facilities. These facilities can be libraries, public meeting halls, sports fields, health care facilities, courthouses, marketplaces, conference rooms, office buildings, etc. A continuous route means that circulating through it is safe, unrestricted and possible using a wheelchair, a walking frame or a service dog, with no obstacles or barriers blocking the way. Such a route must be continuous because, like in a chain, if one link is broken, the chain is compromised.\n\nFour steps ensure the accessibility continuum: reaching a facility; entering a facility; moving around a facility; and using specific features of a facility. ${ }^{4}$ These align with the RECU methodology that stipulates that accessible facilities should be easy to reach, enter, circulate and use. ${ }^{5}$\n\nPlanning for an accessible environment requires a broad vision of the accessibility continuum perspective. For example, if the route from home to school is accessible for a child who uses crutches but there are stairs at the school entrance and classroom doors are hard to push and pull, the child will have difficulty entering the school or learning and participating in activities with his/her peers.\n\nSimilarly, if a UNICEF staff member using a wheelchair has an adjustable desk, an accessible work space with appropriate doorway sizes and accessible toilets, he/she will be able to work on an equal basis with others. However, if he/she is unable to independently access the building because there is no accessible parking space, dropoff zone or kerb (ramp) to get on the sidewalk, the overall accessibility of the workplace is compromised.\n\nAt least 10 common pitfalls can be avoided or remedied, often at low or no cost, to achieve an accessibility continuum.",

Attitudes can be improved through role models, interaction with other teachers and students with disabilities, experiential training or campaigns, and programmes to transform harmful social norms.",

Some of these gaps can be filled through access to reasonable accommodation.\n\n# Technical accessibility standards \n\nMany of the technical specifications in this toolkit are based on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, developed by a committee of experts. In particular, ISO 21542:2011 'Building construction - Accessibility and usability of the built environment' applies to construction and the modification of new and existing buildings and is available to UNICEF staff via the Supply Division.\n\nRelated ISO standards cover accessible lifts (4190-1), emergencies (22320), assistive devices such as tactile walking surface indicators (23599) and graphical symbols for public information and accessibility (7001). Some of the common global symbols used for accessibility are available in the Toolbox.\n\nFor UNICEF programmes, ISO 21542 can be applied to all construction-related activities. While dimensions in the standard are geared primarily towards adults, it also recognizes that people across age levels have different needs, so it incorporates, for example, accessibility in toilets designed for children. In addition, accessibility for children is considered in this toolkit based on other existing guidelines and principles. ${ }^{6}$\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nAs part of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework, ${ }^{7}$ accessibility of the built environment is referred to explicitly in the targets and indicators for:\n\nGoal 4 - Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\n\nTarget 4.A - Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all",

The first, CF/EXD/2011-005 on disability, sets out the minimum requirements for the accessibility of UNICEF premises and procedures for employing staff with disabilities. A disability accommodation fund was also established by UNICEF to support staff with disabilities.\n\nThe second directive, the Executive Directive on Accessibility in UNICEF's ProgrammeRelated Construction Activities, was issued in December 2017 (CF/EXD/2017-004) to systematically address issues related to the accessibility of the physical environment in programmes. This directive requires UNICEF to adopt accessibility and universal design in all projects with governments and partners across all programme areas, and applies to all new construction, remodelling, extensions or repairs both in development and humanitarian contexts. As stated in the directive, \"Accessibility is an enabler that allows children and adults with disabilities to enjoy their rights and entitlements. It is also a precondition for children and adults with disabilities to live independently and participate fully and equally in society\".\n\nThis executive directive supplements the existing requirements for the accessibility of premises in Property and Equipment Policy, Supplement 6 - Guidelines for Premises Management and the UNICEF Greening and Accessibility Fund (GrAF) procedures. The GrAF was established in 2015, generated by a 3 per cent air travel surcharge, with 2 per cent of the fund to be used to finance eco-efficiency projects and 1 per cent to be used for accessibility projects (see also Section D of the toolkit).\n\nAccessibility is an enabler that allows children and adults with disabilities to enjoy their rights and entitlements.

If the activity is simple and not overly technical, anyone with knowledge of accessibility can follow up on certain activities without being an expert. To achieve quality results in more complex and technical interventions, however, as is the case in any other sector, it is important to have expertise on the topic.\n\n## Q2: Do we need to change and improve everything all at once?\n\nNo. The actions need to be prioritized. Some may need to be taken as soon as possible, including to address areas that are potentially dangerous or have restricted access. While many laws require accessibility, it is possible to identify and progressively implement improvements as part of a sequenced approach. People with disabilities can advise on which interventions will promote universal design and inclusion and may be able to share innovative ideas.\n\nAzzam, 12, lost his mobility at the age of 5 when shell fell on his house.
